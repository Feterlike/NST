# Minimalist Network & Security Test

A single-file, zero-dependency tool for analyzing your internet connection's performance, reachability, and security posture.


## üöÄ Features

*   ‚úÖ **Single File:** The entire application (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is contained in a single `.html` file.
*   üí® **Zero Dependencies:** No external libraries, frameworks, or setup required. It runs directly in the browser.
*   üé® **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive, and dark-themed interface that is easy to read and use.
*   üåê **Comprehensive Tests:** Includes performance metrics, international connectivity checks, and critical security/privacy validations.
*   üîí **Privacy-Focused:** The tool is entirely client-side. No data is ever stored or sent to a server owned by the developer.

## üìä Understanding the Tests

The tests are grouped into three main categories: Performance, Service Connectivity, and Security.

### 1. Performance & Geolocation

These tests measure the core characteristics of your connection.

#### Check My IP
*   **What it does:** Fetches your public IP address and its associated country using reliable public APIs. It includes a fallback mechanism for better reliability.
*   **Public IP / Country:** Your public-facing address and the country where the IP is registered.

#### Test Ping
*   **What it does:** Measures network latency‚Äîthe time it takes for a small packet of data to travel to a server and back.
*   **Result (ms):** Measured in milliseconds (ms). **Lower is better.** Crucial for gaming and video calls.

#### Test Download / Test Upload
*   **What it does:** Measures your connection's bandwidth by downloading or uploading a temporary file.
*   **Result (Mbps):** Measured in Megabits per second (Mbps). **Higher is better.** Determines how quickly you can stream, download, or upload content.

### 2. Service Connectivity

These tests verify whether your connection can reach specific popular international services.

#### Test Services
*   **What it does:** Attempts a quick connection to Google, YouTube, Gemini, and ChatGPT to check for regional or firewall blocks.
*   **Results:**
    *   `‚úì Reachable`: Your connection successfully reached the service.
    *   `‚úó Blocked`: Your connection was blocked, likely by a firewall or network restriction.

### 3. Security Checks

These tests validate important privacy and security aspects of your connection.

#### Run Security Checks
*   **WebRTC Leak:**
    *   **What it does:** Checks if your browser's WebRTC functionality is revealing your *real* IP address, which can happen even when using a VPN.
    *   **Note:** This test requires running "Check My IP" first for an accurate baseline comparison.
    *   **Results:**
        *   `‚úì No Leak Detected`: Your WebRTC IP matches your public IP. This is secure.
        *   `‚úó Leak Detected`: A different IP was found, potentially exposing your real location.

*   **Detected DNS Servers:**
    *   **What it does:** Identifies the DNS (Domain Name System) resolvers your system is using. Exposing this can reveal your browsing habits to your ISP.
    *   **"No DNS servers detected":** This is **not an error**. It is often a **positive sign** that your browser's Secure DNS (DoH) or a strong VPN is working correctly, effectively hiding your DNS activity from external probes.

*   **Encrypted DNS:**
    *   **What it does:** Analyzes the list of detected DNS servers to see if they belong to a known provider of encrypted DNS (like DNS-over-HTTPS).
    *   **Results:**
        *   `‚úì Likely Enabled`: Your DNS is handled by a known secure provider (e.g., Cloudflare, Google, Quad9). This is excellent for privacy.
        *   `‚óã Uncertain`: Your DNS servers are not from a known secure provider, or no servers were detected.
